          <h3>Dress Code</h3>
          <p>We’d love for you to address for the occasion not the venue (it really is a field!) but don’t forget your Wellies and Sunnies – it is May in England after all!</p>
              
          <h3>Children</h3>
          <p>It has been a really difficult decision as, in many cases, we prefer your children to you! However, we do have a capacity restriction on the venue and therefore are not able to accommodate children between the ages of 1yo and 16yo on the Saturday (this is apart from children of the wedding party). However, we would welcome all children on the Sunday. If this may prevent you from being able to attend then please contact us dani_winteringham@yahoo.co.uk</p>

          <h3>Hotels</h3>
          <p>If you understandably prefer your overnight accommodation to involve much more brick and mortar then we have listed a couple of recommended choices below. A bus will do collections to the Church and back to these venues (see the transport section below). Please be aware that the Premier Inn and Holiday Inn are the ones adjacent to Norwich Airport. Please take care in ensuring that you definitely select the right one!</p>

          <h2>Honeymoon</h2>
          <p>There have been some salacious rumours circulating that it took Ant a full 6 years to propose. These are, of course entirely false (#fakenews). However, the truth remains that we have happily shared our life together for a few years and are well (over-)stocked on the essentials of day to day living.</p>
              
          <p>We really do want your attendance rather than your hard earned cash so please feel no obligation to buy a gift. However if you do wish to honour tradition and give a gift to celebrate our wedding, please help to contribute to a honeymoon we won’t forget!</p>
