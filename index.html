          <h3>Children</h3>
          <p>It has been a really difficult decision as, in many cases, we prefer your children to you! However, we do have a capacity restriction on the venue and therefore are not able to accommodate children between the ages of 1yo and 16yo on the Saturday (this is apart from children of the wedding party). However, we would welcome all children on the Sunday. If this may prevent you from being able to attend then please contact us dani_winteringham@yahoo.co.uk</p>

          <h2>Honeymoon</h2>
          <p>There have been some salacious rumours circulating that it took Ant a full 6 years to propose. These are, of course entirely false (#fakenews). However, the truth remains that we have happily shared our life together for a few years and are well stocked on the essentials for day to day living.</p>
              
          <p>We really do want your attendance rather than your hard earned cash so please feel no obligation to buy a gift. However if you do wish to honour tradition and give a gift to celebrate our wedding, please help to contribute to a honeymoon we won’t forget!</p>
